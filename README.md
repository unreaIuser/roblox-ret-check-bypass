# Roblox Ret_Check Bypass

RetCheck is basically a Roblox Check that prevents you from doing basic things like allocating console etc, and it's detecting most of basic dlls functions without a working bypass, if you try to for example Allocate a console with Ret_Check, your game will crash, and sometimes gives an "Unexpected client behiavour" error.
